# 2WAY Design


See the [wiki](https://github.com/2WAY/Design/wiki) for the [draft of the whitepaper](https://github.com/2WAY/Design/wiki/Whitepaper), and [FAQ](https://github.com/2WAY/Design/wiki/FAQ). We will add examples in the near future, to explain the concept further.

The 2WAY design is, for the most-part, based on [Identifi](https://github.com/identifi/identifi). The major difference between Identifi and 2WAY is that Identifi is intended for public data, whereas 2WAY's design intends to secure the exchange of private data.

Feel free to post your questions, comments, and/or suggestions as an issue.
